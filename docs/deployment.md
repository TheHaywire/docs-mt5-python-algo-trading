# Deployment & Operations

## 1. Deployment Architecture

    A[Windows Host] --> B[MT5 Terminal]
    A --> C[Python Core Engine]
    C --> D[Strategy Workers]
    C --> E[Monitoring Service]
    C --> F[Config & Credential Store]
    E --> G[Alerting/Notification]
    F --> C
```

## 3. Zero-Downtime Deployment Sequence

```mermaid

    participant Old as Old Engine
    participant New as New Engine
    participant Monitor
    participant User

    User->>New: Deploy new version
    New->>Monitor: Health check
    alt Healthy
        Monitor->>User: Promote new version
        Old->>Old: Shutdown
    else Unhealthy
        Monitor->>User: Rollback
        New->>New: Shutdown
    end
```

## 4. Disaster Recovery Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant Backup
    participant Admin
    participant Logger

    System->>Backup: Automated backup
    System->>Logger: Log backup
    alt Failure detected
        Admin->>Backup: Restore from backup
        Backup->>System: Restore data/config
        System->>Logger: Log restore
    end
```

## 5. Advanced Notes
- All deployments are versioned and validated before going live.
- Automated health checks and monitoring for all services.
- Disaster recovery procedures are tested regularly.

> **TODO:** Add deployment scripts and runbooks for common scenarios.
