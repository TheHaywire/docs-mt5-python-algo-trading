## 1. Risk Control Architecture

    A[Strategy Engine] --> B[Pre-Trade Risk Engine]
    B --> C[Order Manager]
    C --> D[MT5 Broker]
    C --> E[Post-Trade Risk Engine]
    E --> F[Exposure Tracker]
    F --> G[Monitoring Alerting]
    E --> H[Kill Switch]
    H --> G
```

## 2. Pre-Trade Risk Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Strategy
    participant PreRisk as Pre-Trade Risk
    participant Exec as Execution
    participant Logger

    Strategy->>PreRisk: Order request
    PreRisk->>PreRisk: Check limits (size, price, exposure)
    alt Passes all checks
        PreRisk->>Exec: Approve order
        PreRisk-->>Logger: Log approval
    else Fails any check
        PreRisk-->>Logger: Log rejection
        PreRisk-->>Strategy: Reject order
    end
```

## 3. Post-Trade Risk & Monitoring

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Exec
    participant PostRisk as Post-Trade Risk
    participant Exposure
    participant Logger
    participant Alert

    Exec->>PostRisk: Order fill event
    PostRisk->>Exposure: Update positions
    PostRisk->>PostRisk: Check drawdown, PnL, margin
    alt Breach detected
        PostRisk->>Alert: Trigger alert/kill switch
        PostRisk-->>Logger: Log breach
    else No breach
        PostRisk-->>Logger: Log update
    end
```

## 4. Kill Switch State Diagram

```mermaid

    [*] --> Monitoring
    Monitoring --> Triggered: Risk Breach/Manual
    Triggered --> Shutdown: Execute kill switch
    Shutdown --> [*]
```

## 5. Advanced Notes
- All risk checks are parameterized and strategy-aware.
- Real-time monitoring of exposure, drawdown, and margin.
- Automated and manual kill switches for safety.
- All risk events are logged and auditable.

## 6. Real-Time Risk Aggregation & Kill Switch Logic (Expert Level)

### 6.1. Multi-Dimensional Risk Aggregation
- Aggregate risk in real time across strategies, symbols, asset classes, and timeframes
- Track exposures: gross/net, sector, currency, leverage, margin usage
- Real-time VaR (Value at Risk), expected shortfall, and scenario analysis
- Drawdown and PnL attribution by strategy, symbol, and time bucket

### 6.2. Real-Time Stress Testing
- Simulate market shocks (flash crash, spread widening, volatility spike)
- Apply stress scenarios to current portfolio and open orders
- Monitor risk metrics under stress in real time

### 6.3. Kill Switch Logic
- Hard and soft kill switches for risk breaches (drawdown, exposure, margin, connectivity)
- Automated triggers: immediate flattening of positions, order cancellation, system halt
- Manual triggers: secure web UI or CLI for operator intervention
- Backtest kill switch logic using historical risk events

    B --> C[VaR Drawdown Exposure Monitors]
    C --> D[Stress Testing Engine]
    D --> E[Kill Switch Logic]
    E --> F[Order Manager]
    F --> G[Execution Engine]
    E --> H[Alerting Monitoring]
    B --> I[PnL Attribution]
    I --> J[Reporting]
```

### 6.5. Actionable Implementation Notes
- Use a real-time risk engine with streaming data architecture
- Parameterize all risk limits and allow for dynamic adjustment
- Integrate kill switch logic with both automated and manual triggers
- Backtest risk aggregation and kill switch logic using historical data
- Log all risk events and actions for audit and compliance
