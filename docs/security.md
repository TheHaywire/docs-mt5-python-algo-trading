## 3. Incident Response Flow

    System->>Logger: Log all actions
```

## 4. Advanced Notes
- All credentials are encrypted at rest and only decrypted in memory.
- Role-based access control for all sensitive actions.
- All access and security events are logged for compliance.
- Incident response procedures are documented and tested.

## 5. Advanced Security, Compliance & Audit (Expert Level)

### 5.1. Real-Time Compliance Monitoring
- Monitor for wash trading, spoofing, layering, and market manipulation
- Track order-to-trade ratios, cancellation rates, and order book manipulation
- Real-time alerts for potential compliance violations
- Integration with regulatory reporting systems

### 5.2. Audit Trail & Tamper-Proofing
- Immutable audit logs for all trades, orders, and system actions
- Cryptographic signatures and blockchain-style integrity checks
- Time-stamped logs with user/process attribution
- Secure storage and backup of audit trails

### 5.3. Access Control & Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all system components
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Secure credential management and encryption
- Network security and intrusion detection

```

### 5.5. Actionable Implementation Notes
- Use cryptographic hashing and digital signatures for audit trail integrity
- Implement real-time compliance monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Maintain secure, encrypted storage for all sensitive data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

> **TODO:** Add compliance check templates and audit trail implementation details.

## Credential Rotation & Incident Response
- Rotate all credentials (API keys, passwords, certificates) on a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly)
- Use secure vaults for credential storage and access
- In case of suspected compromise:
  - [ ] Immediately revoke and rotate affected credentials
  - [ ] Notify security and compliance leads
  - [ ] Conduct root cause analysis and document incident
  - [ ] Review and update access control policies

---

## Penetration Testing & Security Audit Checklist
- [ ] Schedule regular penetration tests (at least annually)
- [ ] Review and update threat models
- [ ] Remediate all critical and high findings promptly
- [ ] Document all tests, findings, and remediations
- [ ] Review access logs and privilege escalations

## Data Privacy & GDPR/CCPA Compliance
- [ ] Identify and document all personal/sensitive data collected
- [ ] Ensure data minimization and purpose limitation
- [ ] Implement data subject rights (access, deletion, correction)
- [ ] Maintain data retention and deletion schedules
- [ ] Review and document all data sharing with third parties
- [ ] Train staff on data privacy obligations
