## Operational Playbook: Handling Losses, Risk Breaches, and Anomalies

### 1. Losses Exceed Daily Threshold
- **Action:**
  - System triggers a kill switch and halts trading.
  - Review trade logs and PnL attribution to identify the source.
  - Adjust strategy parameters or disable underperforming strategies.
  - Resume trading only after risk review.

### 2. Risk Limit Breach (VaR, Drawdown, Leverage)
- **Action:**
  - System blocks new trades and sends an alert.
  - Investigate which strategy or symbol caused the breach.
  - Reduce position sizes or capital allocation.
  - Document the incident and corrective actions.

### 3. System Anomaly Detected (Data Feed, Execution, Monitoring)
- **Action:**
  - System sends an alert and logs the anomaly.
  - Check system health dashboards and logs.
  - Restart affected components if needed.
  - Escalate to engineering if unresolved.

### 4. Post-Mortem & Continuous Improvement
- **Action:**
  - After any major incident, conduct a post-mortem.
  - Document root cause, impact, and lessons learned.
  - Update runbooks and risk controls as needed.
