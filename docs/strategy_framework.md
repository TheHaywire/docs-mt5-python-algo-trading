# Strategy Framework

## 1. Strategy Plug-in Architecture

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class IStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +on_startup()
        +on_data()
        +on_order_fill()
        +on_shutdown()
        +generate_signals()
    }
    class MomentumStrategy
    class MeanReversionStrategy
    class ArbitrageStrategy
    class StrategyManager
    class FeatureStore
    class StatePersistence

    IStrategy <|-- MomentumStrategy
    IStrategy <|-- MeanReversionStrategy
    IStrategy <|-- ArbitrageStrategy
    StrategyManager o-- IStrategy

```

## 2. Strategy Lifecycle Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as StrategyManager
    participant Strategy as IStrategy
    participant Feature as FeatureStore
    participant State as StatePersistence

    Manager->>Strategy: on_startup()
    loop On new data
        Manager->>Strategy: on_data(market_event)
        Strategy->>Feature: Fetch features
        Strategy->>Strategy: Generate signal
        Strategy->>Manager: Signal (buy/sell/hold)
        Manager->>State: Save state
    end
    Manager->>Strategy: on_shutdown()
```

---

## 3. State Management & Extensibility
- Each strategy maintains its own persistent state (for ML models, signals, etc.).
- Feature store provides engineered features for all strategies.
- Strategies are loaded dynamically via config (plug-in pattern).
- Inter-strategy communication via message bus for portfolio-level logic.

---

## 4. Example Strategy Config (YAML)
```yaml
strategies:
  - name: "Momentum"
    params:
      lookback: 20
      threshold: 0.01
  - name: "MeanReversion"
    params:
      lookback: 50
      entry_z: 2.0
```

---

> **TODO:** Add code snippets for base strategy class and plug-in loader.
