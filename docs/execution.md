# Execution & Order Management

## 1. Order Lifecycle Flow

```mermaid

    A[Order Request] --> B[Order Manager]
    B --> C[Order Router]
    C --> D[MT5 API Adapter]
    D --> E[Broker]
    D --> F[Order Status Listener]
    F --> B
    B --> G[Order Book]
    G --> H[Reconciliation]
    H --> I[Logger]
```

## 2. Order Placement & Error Handling Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Strategy
    participant OrderMgr as Order Manager
    participant Router as Order Router
    participant MT5 as MT5 API
    participant Logger

    Strategy->>OrderMgr: Place order
    OrderMgr->>Router: Route order
    Router->>MT5: Send order
    alt Success
        MT5-->>Router: Order confirmation
        Router-->>OrderMgr: Update status
        OrderMgr-->>Logger: Log fill
    else Failure/Error
        MT5-->>Router: Error/Reject
        Router-->>OrderMgr: Notify error
        OrderMgr-->>Logger: Log error
        OrderMgr-->>Strategy: Notify failure
    end
```

## 3. Reconciliation Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant OrderBook
    participant MT5
    participant Logger

    loop Periodic
        OrderBook->>MT5: Query open/filled orders
        MT5-->>OrderBook: Return order status
        OrderBook->>Logger: Log discrepancies
    end
```

## 4. Advanced Notes
- Asynchronous, non-blocking order placement and status polling.
- Internal order book tracks all open, filled, and canceled orders.
- Reconciliation ensures system and broker state are always in sync.
- All order events and errors are logged for auditability.

## 5. Execution Microstructure & Latency Management (Expert Level)

### 5.1. Order Book State Machine
- Track order book events: new order, cancel, modify, trade, partial fill
- Maintain internal state for best bid/ask, depth, queue position, and imbalance
- Detect microstructure signals: sweep, fade, spoof, hidden liquidity

### 5.2. Latency Budget & Event Timing
- Map end-to-end latency: data feed → signal → order → broker → fill
- Profile and optimize each stage (network, processing, broker, exchange)
- Use nanosecond-precision clocks and timestamping

### 5.3. Market Impact & Slippage Modeling
- Estimate expected slippage based on order size, liquidity, and volatility
- Model market impact for aggressive vs. passive orders
- Simulate adverse selection and partial fill scenarios in backtests

### 5.4. Advanced Execution Tactics
- Iceberging, layering, and randomization to minimize footprint
- Smart order routing (SOR) for best venue/liquidity
- Adaptive order sizing and timing based on real-time market conditions
- Immediate-or-cancel (IOC), fill-or-kill (FOK), and pegged order logic

### 5.5. Microsecond-Level Execution Flow Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DataFeed as Data Feed
    participant Signal as Signal Engine
    participant Exec as Execution Engine
    participant Broker as MT5/Broker
    participant Logger

    DataFeed->>Signal: Tick/Order Book Event [t0]
    Signal->>Exec: Signal (buy/sell/hold) [t1]
    Exec->>Broker: Place order (with tactics) [t2]
    Broker-->>Exec: Order status/fill [t3]
    Exec-->>Logger: Log event (with all timestamps)
```

### 5.6. Actionable Implementation Notes
- Use a high-resolution event loop (asyncio, Cython, or C++ extension)
- Maintain a rolling order book state for microstructure analysis
- Timestamp every event at each stage for latency analysis
- Integrate market impact and slippage models into backtesting and live execution
- Continuously profile and optimize latency at every stage
