# Testing & Validation

## 1. Test Coverage Architecture

## 2. Test Orchestration Flow

```mermaid

    participant Dev as Developer
    participant CI as CI Pipeline
    participant Test as Test Runner
    participant Repo as Code Repo

    Dev->>Repo: Push code
    Repo->>CI: Trigger pipeline
    CI->>Test: Run unit/integration/chaos tests
    Test->>CI: Report results
    CI->>Dev: Notify pass/fail
```

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Diagram

```mermaid

    A[Code Commit] --> B[CI Pipeline]
    B --> C[Lint/Test]
    C --> D[Build]
    D --> E[Deploy to Staging]
    E --> F[Automated Tests]
    F --> G[Deploy to Production]
```

## 4. Advanced Notes
- All core modules have 90%+ unit test coverage.
- Integration tests simulate end-to-end trading workflows.
- Chaos testing injects faults to validate system resilience.
- CI/CD pipelines automate linting, testing, and deployment.

> **TODO:** Add test case templates and CI/CD configuration examples.
